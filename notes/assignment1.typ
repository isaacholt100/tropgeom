- What is the field $C{{t}}$ (field of complex Puiseux series)
- What is the tropicalisation $"trop"(V(w - x^2 y + x y^2)) subset.eq RR^3$ where $w - x^2 y + x y^2 in K[w, x, y]$ where $V$ is vanishing set (where polynomial is zero). (Draw a picture with an explanation). Come back to Yue when you've got the answer. How is it different where $w - x^alpha + x^beta$, $x^alpha = x_1^(alpha_1) ... x_m^(alpha_m)$, similarly for $beta$.

Make notes in a Latex/typst file, based on things read from book, then can write up into a report at the end.
